# Abstract Classes 
> Classes that cannot be instantiated directly and are used as base classes for inheritance.
> https://pumpkinprogrammerdotcom4.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/abstract-1.jpg

 # Interfaces
> A contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement.

# Abstraction
> The process of simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary details.

# Access Modifiers (Public, Private, Protected)
> control visibility of class members.

# Attributes / Properties
> are the characteristics or data members of a class or object. They define the properties of an instance of a class.

# Class Variable
> Shared by all instances of a class.

# Classes
> Blueprints for creating objects. They define the attributes and behaviors of objects.

# Composition
> is a strong "has-a" relationship between objects, where one object is part of another and cannot exist independently. It represents a whole-part relationship.

# Constructors
> Special methods that initialize objects when they are created.

# Destructors
> Special methods that are called when objects are destroyed, often to release resources.

# Design Patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer)
> blueprints for common software problems. They help you build better, more flexible, and maintainable software.

# Encapsulation
> The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (class). This promotes data hiding and modularity.

# Exception Handling
> is a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully.

# File I/O in OOP
> is used to read and write data to and from files.

# Friends
> are special functions that can access private and protected members of a class. They are declared within the class using the friend keyword.

# Generics
> Allow you to write flexible code that can work with different data types.

# Templates
>are a way to write generic code that can work with different data types. They allow you to create reusable components that can be adapted to various data types.

# Inheritance
> The mechanism by which one class (child class) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (parent class), creating a hierarchical relationship.

# Instance Variable
> Unique to each instance of a class.

# Member Variable
> is a variable declared within a class. It holds data associated with an object of that class.

# Memory Management (Garbage Collection, Pointers)
> is the process of allocating and deallocating memory to programs.

# Method Overloading
> is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

# Method
> Functions defined within a class. They operate on the class's data.

# Multiple Inheritance
> is a feature in some object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes.

# Multithreading in OOP (time permitting)
> is the ability to execute multiple threads of execution concurrently within a single program.

# Object Relationships (Association, Aggregation, Composition)
> describe how objects interact with each other.

# Object-Oriented Design Principles
> are guidelines for designing object-oriented software.

# Operator Overloading
> is the ability to redefine the behavior of operators for user-defined data types.

# Overloading
> is the ability to define multiple methods or functions with the same name but different parameters.

# Polymorphism
> The ability of objects of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type. It allows for flexible and extensible code.

# Public
> Accessible from anywhere outside the class.

# Private
>  Not accessible from anywhere outside the class.

# Protected
> Accessible within the class and its subclasses.

# SOLID Principles
> are a set of five fundamental principles for object-oriented design.

# Static Methods
> are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of a class. They can be called without creating an object of the class.

# Static Variables
> are variables that belong to a class rather than an instance of a class.

# Testing in OOP (Unit Testing, Test-Driven Development)
> is the process of verifying the correctness of object-oriented software.

# UML Diagrams and Modeling
>  Visual representations of software systems.

# Virtual
> is a keyword used in object-oriented programming to declare a function as virtual.
